We're pretty early in development, so submitting any issues or requests is greatly appreciated

I started up this project because I wanted something fluid and understandable.
- Fluid: in the sense of not being dependent, and having the control to fix any problems I see, when I see it.
- Understandable: everything should read somewhat nicely, and for the most part, make sense to users at some displayed level of abstraction. (in general, the interface (.h files) should give a sufficient sense of usage).
- Portability: All I care to enforce as of right now is that everything works on Windows and Linux, I do not want to sacrafice too much in understandability to suit consoles, however I'm open to suggestions.

I'll setup an email here soon for any requests to help develop!
