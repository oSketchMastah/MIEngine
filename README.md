# MIEngine

A collection of types and C++ code that helps.

Works on Linux and Windows. 
Uses concepts from C++20 standard in at least a few things (see MIDetectionTesting.h for an example), otherwise uses many features from C++17.

When I'm feeling clever enough to write something neat, and think it sensible in the eyes of a beholder, you'll find it here.
