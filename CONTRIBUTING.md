First of all, thanks for considering contributing! Even just submitting issues or requests is greatly appreciated

There are a lot of reasons I started up this project, from simply wanting a codebase that I can navigate really efficiently, and make good macroscopic decisions on, to just wanting to help.

If you like what's coming out of this project, and you feel up to the task of working with me in any stage of the tasks here (from conceptualizing good features, to designing efficient structures and interfaces, or writing and reviewing their implementations, or even tests) you can email mqwillems@gmail.com to inquire.
I don't bite! I have good intuition, I enjoy going over ideas of mine or others with any level of programmer. 
If you want to contribute, feel free to send a bit about yourself and your experience with programming and low-level languages like C and C++ in particular.
